Hello and welcome to Bit Ranch Labs!

What is BRL? Well, BRL is an attempt to put all my thoughts, knowledge,
projects, things, tools, ideas, experiments -- you get the idea -- into a
single website. I will still post to [0x44.pw](https://www.0x44.pw) (not that
I've posted there in a looooooong while) and I will also post to my work's
[blog](https://oteemo.com/blog) once in a while, but I also plan to copy
all/most of that stuff here. Because this is a _unified_ website, topics are
going to be a bit more numerous. Like at 0x44.pw, software engineering, systems
engineering, Linux ricing, and other technology related stuff will be posted
here. However, in addition to that I'll be posting about farming, fabricating,
tractors, home repairs, self-sufficiency, community, theology, philosophy,
worldview -- again, you get the idea!
